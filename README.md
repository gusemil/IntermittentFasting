# IntermittentFasting
 .NET MAUI/C# (Android) App for tracking intermittent fasting with customizable intermittent fasting periods (default 16:8)

 You can set your own fasting period to match your needs in the settings page. The app has notifications to let you know the fasting or eating period is done and when there is only one hour left.
 By default notifications are on, but you can toggle them off in the settings page.
